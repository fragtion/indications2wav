# indications2wav

`indications2wav` is a small, standalone Python3 script designed to generate WAV files for tone data found in Asterisk configuration file `indications.conf`.
This script generates tones based on the tone definitions found in the configuration file, and creates a WAV file for each tone.
The script allows for customized playback duration and audio sample rate, for the output WAV files.
The script uses only built-in Python libraries, so getting it working should be a quick and simple process!

## Usage

To use `indications2wav`, simply run the script:
./indications2wav.py

No additional command line options are needed. Simply ensure that the `indications.conf` file is present, and readable/valid.

Suggestions & contributions are welcome!
